# bulltwitter

Here's how it works:

1. Launch bulltwitter.rb, which creates a Twitter client process and monitors websockets.
2. Open map.html in browser.
3. Right-click spot on map, select "Tweet from here" or "Tweet + Image from here".
4. bulltwitter script creates a tweet geotagged with that location. Create an entire fake vacation narrative while you stay indoors and live on Cheetos for a week!
